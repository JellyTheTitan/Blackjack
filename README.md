# Blackjack
A recreation of one of the most popular card games in the world.
You are going to need to know how to play this game, as I do not have
any instructions for how to play.

## How to Run
Running the file `bj_engine.py` will require you to use either option:

- Download the latest Python installer [here](python.org/downloads).
- Create an account (if you don't already have one) and run it on [Replit](replit.com/~).

## P.S...
You might cringe at the code, as I made it over a year ago when I didn't understand
the concept of efficiency.
